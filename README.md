# LAB - 2

## About Me

This is a webpage that talks a little about myself, my journey into coding, and what I'm hoping for going into CodeFellows. Contains a mini-quiz about myself, which is then put on the site as well as `alerted` back to the visitor. In fact, it asks for the users name, and refers to them in the dialogue.

## Reflections and Comments

Okay, so this site is actually a bit out of scope of what was asked, what with all the element creating at the bottom. I really got carried away because I was having a great time coding. You know how it is. I'm just glad that it didn't increase the scope of the lab to the point where I couldn't complete it on time, which has actually been a real issue in the past, and of course will be in the future if I'm not smart about projects. Otherwise, this went super smoothly and like I said, had fun all the way throughout.
