# LAB - 2 & 3

## About Me

This is a webpage that talks a little about myself, my journey into coding, and what I'm hoping for going into CodeFellows. Contains a mini-quiz about myself, which is then put on the site as well as `alerted` back to the visitor. In fact, it asks for the users name, and refers to them in the dialogue.

### Additions in Lab 3

In the third lab, I have reworked the quiz to give instant feedback instead of prompting 5 times then giving all the feedback at once. On top of that it supports numerical questions, and word questions that can be an assortment of answers. I have added a section for a top ten places to visit, and a section on my educational and job history.

## Reflections and Comments

### End of Lab 2

Okay, so this site is actually a bit out of scope of what was asked, what with all the element creating at the bottom. I really got carried away because I was having a great time coding. You know how it is. I'm just glad that it didn't increase the scope of the lab to the point where I couldn't complete it on time, which has actually been a real issue in the past, and of course will be in the future if I'm not smart about projects. Otherwise, this went super smoothly and like I said, had fun all the way throughout.

### End of Lab 3

My thoughts on how this went: Most of the work was in moving over the old system to the new one. Also, I kinda wish I could dig into functions and types and whatnot but I know better than to jump ahead like last time. I'm pretty happy with the result too, it runs way better what with the back and forth. The website itself received a pretty substantial visual upgrade too, which is good because my other classmates have some seriously pretty sites. Last time I didn't get the stretch goal done but I still felt alright about how I did, this time I actually got the stretch goal done and I feel even better!

And yet here we are, I still cannot get the picture to just not intrude on the rest of the webpage on smaller monitors. Curse you, image of my cat!
