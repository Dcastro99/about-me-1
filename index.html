  <h1>About Hugo Thompson</h1>

  <blockquote>
    Hi! I'm Hugo Thompson, and here's a little bit about myself. I first started coding in 2017 right in the middle of highschool, and I realized
    that it's actually a lot of fun. I kept learning code throughout highschool until I graduated in 2019, when Covid-19 struck. I decided to take
    a break year because hey this Covid thing is really going to hamper the university experience, and I got all my tools right here for me to keep
    learning! Only, maybe I was underestimating how long Covid would take to move on, because now we're here, and I decided to join CodeFellows to
    get some official education to fill in the holes in what I know from self learning.

  <p class="mygoals">
    Out of this experience, I really want two things over all:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Get a lot better at coding...
      </li>
      <li>
        And meet some friends along the way!
      </li>
    </ol>
